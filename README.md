# PNlib

[![Test][test-badge]][test-link]

Free Modelica library for modelling xHPN.

## Library description

The advanced Petri Net library, called PNlib, enables the modeling of extended
hybrid Petri Nets (xHPN). It comprises

  * discrete (PD) and continuous places (PC),
  * discrete (TD), stochastic (TS), and continuous transitions (TC), and
  * test (TA), inhibitor (IA), and read arcs (RA).

![iconsxHPN][pnlib-img]

The main package PNlib is divided into the following sub-packages:

  * _Interfaces_: contains the connectors of the Petri net component models.
  * _Blocks_: contains blocks with specific procedures that are used in the Petri
    net component models.
  * _Functions_: contains functions with specific algorithmic procedures which
    are used in the Petri net component models.
  * _Constants_: contains constants which are used in the Petri net component
    models.
  * _Examples_: contains several examples and unit tests.
